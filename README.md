# TRA's : Analysis of Road Traffic Accident in Metro Manila
## Introduction
In large cities with numerous modes of transportation, accidents are common, and roadways are becoming increasingly narrow and congested. Accidents like these cause both human and material loss. Drivers' carelessness, as well as their ignorance and disdain for traffic rules, are to blame. The variables that impact the severity of traffic collisions The severity of road traffic accidents is influenced by several factors, including driver age, driving time, driving day, and province. Accidents have grown far too common in recent years. As the number of people who own cars in Metro Manila grows, so does the incidence of traffic incidents. In addition, people are becoming more careless at this time. Only a small portion of the population adheres to traffic laws. Various kinds of transportation are available, especially in large urban areas. Furthermore, streets are narrowing and urban areas are becoming more densely populated. Furthermore, the most serious traffic incidents involve huge vehicles such as trucks and buses. To lower the number and severity of accidents, the government should improve traffic legislation. Because driving speed has been linked to accident severity, the government should consider enforcing speed restrictions, particularly late at night when traffic is light. It should act as a wake-up call to the government to build and strengthen safe driving infrastructure. The increasing number of cars on the road and, as a result, the increasing frequency of RTAs necessitates the implementation of traffic safety measures. The fast rising economy has aided the development of further RTAs as the usage of automobiles for transportation has increased (Johansson et al., 2014). Late-night driving, according to other studies, has a fairly consistent traffic flow. Drivers frequently speed up to take advantage of the steady flow of traffic. As a result, late-night occurrences are more likely to result in death. As a result, to reduce RTAs, additional traffic enforcement and traffic education measures are required. The purpose of this study is to look into the level of injuries suffered by victims of car accidents in Metro Manila. In addition, by identifying critical gaps and opportunities, this study intends to raise awareness in the region and push the government to take action to improve road safety.
## Problem Statement
Road traffic accidents are a big problem nowadays. Drivers paying less attention to various site routing signage on the road, as well as a lack of awareness of road traffic accidents, which causes harm to life and other vehicle properties. The state of Metro Manila's roadways has deteriorated significantly in recent years due to a variety of factors. Increased vehicle numbers, as well as a lack of sufficient road safety, are all contributing factors. In addition, interventions and a lack of enforcement legislation are only a few instances. Overspeeding kills or injures a high number of persons on the road when drivers disregard the speed limit and drive too fast. Some drivers use their cellphones while driving, diverting their focus away from the road.
